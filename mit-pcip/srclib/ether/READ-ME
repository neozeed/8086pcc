There are actually two ethernet libraries, libether.a and libwether.a. The
former is the normal ethernet driver while the latter is for use with
netwatch. The Makefile will construct them both; conditional compilation is
used to share most of the code. The Makefile is somewhat awkward because of
a problem we ran into with make.
