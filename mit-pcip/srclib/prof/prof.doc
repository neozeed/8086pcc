To make a profilable program:
	Link in pcrt.b or pnetcrt.b instead of crt.b or netcrt.b. Link
in the libprof.a before libS.a by saying -lprof before -lS in the ld86
line. Keep around the a.out file.

To profile a program:
	Run the profilable program. When it finishes, it should leave
behind a file called profile.pro. Transfer this program to the
appropriate vax in image mode. On the vax, run merge giving it the
a.out file and the profile.pro file as arguments.
